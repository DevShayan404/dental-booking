                your medical history, and other medical and health information

                our behalf, which may include but not limited an enhanced
                experience of the website/portal, to provide you an opportunity

              We also may need to disclose your Personal Information or any
              other information we collect about you if we determine in good
              faith that such disclosure is needed to: (1) comply with

            <strong> Public Information </strong>
            <p>
              Any information that you may reveal in a review posting or online
              discussion or forum is intentionally open to the public and is not
              in any way private. We recommend that you carefully consider
              whether to disclose any Personal Information in any public posting
              or forum. What you have written may be seen and/or collected by
              third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to
              control or predict.

            <strong>Storage and Security of Information</strong>
            <p>
              The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We
              endeavor to follow generally accepted industry standards to
              protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during
              transmission and in storage. For example, when you enter sensitive

              socket layer technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although we make good faith efforts to store Personal Information
              in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public,
              we do not and cannot guarantee the security of your Personal
              Information. If we become aware that your Personal Information has
              been disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this Privacy
              Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the nature
              and extent of the disclosure (to the extent we know that
              information) as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted or
              required by law.
